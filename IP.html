            The EonCanvas Platform enables open collaboration between multidisciplinary teams. Below are the terms regarding intellectual property, which ensure that contributors can share their ideas without losing ownership.
        </p>

            <h3>1. Overview</h3>
            <p>The platform encourages participants to share ideas safely without giving up IP ownership, fostering an environment where ideas can be built upon to solve complex challenges.</p>

            <h3>2. Ownership of Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p><strong>2.1 Contributor-Owned IP</strong><br>
            Contributors retain full ownership of pre-existing IP. Sharing or disclosing such IP on the platform does not transfer ownership unless otherwise agreed.</p>

            <p><strong>2.2 Collaborative IP</strong><br>
            For IP created through collaboration, ownership will be determined by contribution agreements between team members. Pre-existing IP remains with the original owner.</p>

            <h3>3. Rights to Use Contributed IP</h3>
            <p>By contributing IP, participants grant non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses for project purposes, limited to evaluation, testing, or development.</p>

            <h3>4. Commercialization of IP</h3>
            <p><strong>4.1 Contributor Commercialization</strong><br>
            Contributors can independently commercialize their IP shared on the platform.</p>

            <p><strong>4.2 EonCanvas Platform Commercialization</strong><br>
            If EonCanvas Platform seeks to commercialize collaboratively created IP, explicit written consent from the original IP owner is required.</p>

            <h3>5. Confidentiality and IP Protection</h3>
            <p>Participants agree to keep confidential information private unless a specific Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is in place.</p>

            <h3>6. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>In case of disputes regarding IP ownership, parties must seek mediation first before arbitration under a recognized arbitration body.</p>
